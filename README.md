# Sentiment Analysis using NLP and LSTM

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a full pipeline for sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning.

The project is split into two stages:
- **Notebook 1:** Exploratory data analysis and text preprocessing using classical NLP techniques.
- **Notebook 2:** Building and training an LSTM-based deep learning model using Keras to classify sentiment.

## ðŸ“– Notebooks

### ðŸ§¹ 01 - Natural Language Processing
Covers:
- Loading and inspecting the raw IMDb dataset
- Text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- Exploratory analysis on review lengths, word frequencies, and sentiment distribution

### ðŸ¤– 02 - LSTM Sentiment Analysis
Covers:
- Text vectorization and sequence padding
- Using an Embedding Layer to generate word vectors
- Designing and training an LSTM-based neural network
- Plotting training vs. validation accuracy/loss

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Can we train a model to correctly classify a movie review as positive or negative using only the text? This problem showcases the power of combining traditional NLP and modern deep learning.
